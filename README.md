The main goal was to create unit calculator for analysing margin level and for making decisions about which kind of costs to reduce, to analyse users and content. It was found out that online cinema functions inefficiently and has -210% margin by the end of settlement period and avg margin -94% for the whole period and described how to get the 25% margin reducing costs and increasing the subscription price and retention. Fulfilled visualization shows top movie rating and usersâ€™ division by time zones.
3.	Balance sheet of online school lessons. The main task was to write sql query for analysing current situation and to create visualization to interpret data. Done inferences: there is a balance sum upward curve that shows the developing trend of school, sales jumps are caused by marketing campaigns.
